# OLLAMA LLMs and Planning

This repo is forked from [PlanBench](https://github.com/harshakokel/PlanBench) and modified so diverse models from OLLAMA can be evaluated. The repo also includes an [ngrok-google_colab](ollama_collab_ngrok.ipynb) integration in order to run the different models in the Computational Units of Google.

## Models evaluated
