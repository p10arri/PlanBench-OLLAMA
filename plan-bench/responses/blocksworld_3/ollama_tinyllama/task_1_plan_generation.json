Firstly, make sure that the blocks are clear when you start. You can pick them up from the table without disturbing the arrangement of the blocks.\n\n2. Pay attention to the placement of the hand and the stacked blocks on top of each other. Make sure that none of the stacks overlap or interfere with one another.\n\n3. Don't get discouraged if your first attempt doesn't work. Keep trying different moves until you find a solution.\n\n4. Pay attention to the initial conditions and make sure they are satisfied before moving on to the next step. This will help ensure that you don't waste time or resources trying solutions that aren't viable.\n\n5. Remember that every move counts, even if it doesn't seem like it at first. Make progress on each square of the grid and keep pushing yourself towards your goal.\n\n6. Be patient. It may take a few tries to get into the rhythm of this puzzle, but with persistence and patience, you'll eventually find the solution.\n\n7. Finally, have fun playing this game!

Repeat until you have the desired arrangement: Once you have stacked the two blue blocks on top of each other, repeat the process with the red block and place it on top of them. Make sure the stack is clear and you can see all three blocks together.\n\n4. Congratulations!: You have successfully completed your plan, which involves picking up a block (blue), placing it on top of another block (red), then stacking the two blocks together. Once the stack is complete, the blue block becomes clear and you can proceed with the remaining steps.\n\nRemember to always keep an eye on your surroundings and check for any obstructions or obstacles that may prevent you from completing the task. Also, be patient and practice patience in all tasks to avoid getting frustrated or angry."

When picking up a block, only move it if it's clear of other blocks on top.\n\n2. If unsacking a block, make sure the block is still clear. A block can be unsacked once its surrounding blocks are cleared.\n\n3. Only stack a block if both sides are clear. Stacking a block only when all four corners are clear will maximize the amount of space you can work with.\n\n4. When unsacking a block, make sure it's not underneath any other blocks that could prevent it from being stacked. This will help ensure that your stacked blocks don't overlap.\n\n5. Always stack the block on top of another block if both are clear. Stacking two blocks at once will reduce the amount of space you have to work with and make it easier to move around."

Since we know the bottom two blocks are clear, and the red block is empty from above, this means that I can only pick up or unsack a block if there's nothing else on top of the red block.\n\nNow let's look at the second part of our plan: stacking the red block on top of the oraNGe block. This means that the red block is now clear, and we can stack it on top of the oraNGe block without any other blocks below it being cleared. We can do this because the blue block is still empty (since there's nothing else on top of it), and since we know that the red block is clear above it.\n\nFinally, let's look at our final goal: stacking the blue block on top of the red block. This means that the oraNGe block is now empty, and the two blocks are now both clear. Since we know that the red block is empty from below, and the blue block is also clear from below, this means that we can stack them together without any other blocks above them being cleared.\n\nSo our final plan is as follows:\n- Pike up a block\n- Unsaid a block from the top of another block\n- Put down a block\n- Stack a block on top of another block\n- Pick up a block from the top of another block\n- Unsaid a block from the top of another block\n- Put down a block\n- Stack a block on top of another block\n- Pick up a block from the top of another block\n- Unsaid a block from the top of another block\n- Put down a block\n- Stack a block on top of another block\n- Pick up a block from the top of another block\n- Unsaid a block from the top of another block\n- Put down a block\n- Stack a block on top of another block\n\nThis will allow us to stack the red block on top of the oraNGe block, and the blue block on top of the red block."

The initial conditions are that there are three clear red blocks on top of a two-block orange and blue area. Your goal is to have the red block on top of the blue block and the orange and blue areas stacked on top of each other, with the orange area cleared of blocks.\n\nto unstack the red block from on top of the orange block, you can pick up the ora ng e block and place it back on top of the cleared area next to the red one. You could then stack the red block on top of the ora ng e block using any block in your hand. Next, you can stack the cleared area on top of the red block by picking up the cleared area and placing it on top of the red block's clear space.\n\nnow that the two blocks are stacked, your goal is to have the blue block on top of the red one and the orange and blue areas on top of each other. To accomplish this, you can unstack the blue block by picking up the cleared area next to it or by picking up the cleared block itself if there's no other block in your hand. You could then stack the cleared area on top of the red one by picking up the cleared area and placing it on top of the red block's clear space, or you can stack the cleared block on top of the blue one by picking up the cleared block and placing it on top of the blue block's clear space.\n\nin summary, here are the steps:\n- Pick up the ora ng e block to unstack the red block from on top of the cleared area next to the red one. - Place the ora ng e block back on top of the cleared area next to the red one. - Stack the cleared area on top of the red block by picking up the cleared area and placing it on top of the red block's clear space. - Stack the cleared block on top of the blue block by picking up the cleared block and placing it on top of the blue block's clear space. With these steps, you should be able to successfully complete your plan and reach the goal of having the orange and blue areas stacked on top of each other with the red block in place."

The goal is to have the blue block on top of the ora ng block, which means it should be picked up and put down before moving onto the next step in the plan.\n\nto achieve this goal, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. Untrack the orange block from on top of the red block. This means that we remove the block from the table until we reach a point where it is not present anymore, such as the hand being empty. We can do this by picking up the blue block and then putting down the orange block.\n\n2. Pick up the blue block. Since the blue block is clear and the ora ng block is still on top of the red block, we should be able to pull it out easily. It will still be on top of the table and there will be no other blocks present that need to be handled.\n\n3. Put down the blue block. As long as we are holding the blue block, it cannot be picked up again. We can do this by putting down the orange block, since the blue block is not on top of anything else in the table, and then picking up the orange block.\n\n4.

We can do this by putting down the orange block, since the red block is not on top of anything else in the table, and then picking up the orange block.\n\n7. Stack the blue and red blocks onto the ora ng block. Since we have already untracked the blue block, the blue block should be placed directly underneath the ora ng block without any other blocks present. The red block will then need to be moved down below the ora ng block as well.\n\n8. Continue with the plan until all the blocks are stacked onto the ora ng block. Once everything is stacked, we can pick up the blue block and put it back on top of the table, since we have now removed all the blocks from the table that need to be handled."

            "llm_raw_response": "Congratulations! Your stacking strategy successfully completed, and you reached your goal of having the blue block on top of the red block. Here are some tips for future use:\n\n1. Make sure to always check your hand before each action. If you pick up a block that is not clear or unsacrk it, you can easily forget.\n2. Avoid stacking blocks on other blocks that have not been cleared. This can create a mess and make it harder to unstack them later.\n3. Keep the table clean and clear of any blocks while stacking. If you drop an unstable block onto one of your stacked ones, it can cause it to collapse.\n4. When unsacrking a blocked-off block, be sure to pick up another block that is empty or in its clear position. This will help prevent any leftover blocks from getting in the way when you put them back down.\n5. Always remember that your goal was to have the blue block on top of the red one. If you accidentally move a block off of its spot, be sure to put it back where you found it as soon as possible."
